# CORE:

1. Understand A* Path Finding tutorial:
    a. Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A
    b. My code:https://github.com/nabeelbaghoor/AIProject
2. Change this code to support RTA* by simply replacingthe
    algorithm functionâ€™s A* code with to RTA* code.
3. Set accordingly and make it work as before!!
4. Add moving obstacles functionality by:
    a. Replacing add "static obstacle" code to "dynamic obstacle"
       code.
    b. Setting things up so that a set of random tiles areassigned to
       each moving obstacle whenever a user adds a new obstacle.
       [user won't be able to assign tiles for obstacle,he can specify
       the location for it though as he clicks!]
    c. Set boundary problems such that the moving obstaclesdon't
       hit or go in walls!
    d. [let some static obstacle code reside to be used inBONUS
       reqs]
    e. [user clicks to add obstacle functionality already
       implemented - as part of BONUS part]
5. Make robot and obstacle animations and user inputeasier to
    understand and use!


# BONUS:

1. [Easy user interaction] simply add UI buttons or anythingfor
    making things easy to do for users, etc.
2. [Switch button for static/dynamic] first, the usershould be able to
    place both types of obstacles(static/dynamic) andcan choose type
    by this switch button.
3. [Beautify things up] by just changing grid style, robot sprite, robot
    animation, obstacle sprite, boundaries, path representation,
    source/destination representations, etc.
4. [Implement an actual robot] with RTA* [EASY] whichcan work with
    moving obstacles as well if placed!! [So, it is aseasy as it was before for
    A* algorithm]
