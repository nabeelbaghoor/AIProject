##CORE:

1. Understand A\* Path Finding tutorial:
   1. Youtube: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A>
   1. My code: <https://github.com/nabeelbaghoor/AIProject>
1. Change this code to support RTA\* by simply replacing the algorithm functionâ€™s A\* code with to RTA\* code.
1. Set accordingly and make it work as before!!
1. Add moving obstacles functionality by:
   1. Replacing add "static obstacle" code to "dynamic obstacle" code. 
   1. Setting things up so that a set of random tiles are assigned to each moving obstacle whenever a user adds a new obstacle. [user won't be able to assign tiles for obstacle, he can specify the location for it though as he clicks!]
   1. Set boundary problems such that the moving obstacles don't hit or go in walls! 
   1. [let some static obstacle code reside to be used in BONUS reqs]
   1. [user clicks to add obstacle functionality already implemented - as part of BONUS part]
1. Make robot and obstacle animations and user input easier to understand and use!




##BONUS:

1. [Easy user interaction] simply add UI buttons or anything for making things easy to do for users, etc.
1. [Switch button for static/dynamic] first, the user should be able to place both types of obstacles(static/dynamic) and can choose type by this switch button.
1. [Beautify things up] by just changing grid style,  robot sprite, robot animation, obstacle sprite, boundaries, path representation, source/destination representations, etc.
1. [Implement an actual robot] with RTA\* [EASY] which can work with moving obstacles as well if placed!! [So, it is as easy as it was before for A\* algorithm]
