# CORE:

1. Understand A\* Path Finding tutorial:
  1. Youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A)
  2. My code: [https://github.com/nabeelbaghoor/AIProject](https://github.com/nabeelbaghoor/AIProject)
2. Change this code to support RTA\* by simply replacing the algorithm function&#39;s A\* code with to RTA\* code.
3. Set accordingly and make it work as before!!
4. Add moving obstacles functionality by:
  1. Replacing add &quot;static obstacle&quot; code to &quot;dynamic obstacle&quot; code.
  2. Setting things up so that a set of random tiles are assigned to each moving obstacle whenever a user adds a new obstacle. [user won&#39;t be able to assign tiles for obstacle, he can specify the location for it though as he clicks!]
  3. Set boundary problems such that the moving obstacles don&#39;t hit or go in walls!
  4. [let some static obstacle code reside to be used in BONUS reqs]
  5. [user clicks to add obstacle functionality already implemented - as part of BONUS part]
5. Make robot and obstacle animations and user input easier to understand and use!

# BONUS:

1. [Easy user interaction] simply add UI buttons or anything for making things easy to do for users, etc.
2. [Switch button for static/dynamic] first, the user should be able to place both types of obstacles(static/dynamic) and can choose type by this switch button.
3. [Beautify things up] by just changing grid style, robot sprite, robot animation, obstacle sprite, boundaries, path representation, source/destination representations, etc.
4. [Implement an actual robot] with RTA\* [EASY] which can work with moving obstacles as well if placed!! [So, it is as easy as it was before for A\* algorithm]
